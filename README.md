# Simon-Game
I built a game modeled off the game Simon. After clicking on the Press to start button, it will show you a tile that you have to click on. As you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated. At some point, if you mess up, it's going to tell you that you got it wrong and game is over and you can click on Try Again to restart the game.
